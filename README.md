# amos-xfce-iso

With that github you can build your own amos-xfce-iso
A fully themed xfce desktop including 80 themes just a klick away

Rising the easy way!
If you don't want the default theme to load after a reboot,just take it out the autostart!
If you need more software, and maybe a TWM like bspwm ,than there is NEMESIS in the .bin folder for you which will install nvidia ,a customised bspwm-desktop and lots of apps !
