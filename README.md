# amos-xfce-iso

With that github you can build your own amos-xfce-iso

If you need more software, and maybe a TWM like bspwm ,than there is NEMESIS in the .bin folder for you which will install nvidia ,a customised bspwm-desktop and lots of apps !

You may download the Iso also here,if you don't want to build
